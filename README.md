# mx-circlediagramwidget
Modified the Mendix Circle Diagram widget slightly for additional functionality

This is a Mendix widget implementation of the jQuery Knob library.

Added an option to add a currency symbol in the widget, in case you want to use this widget to display min/max costs for example.

Current possibilities are:
* None
* Euro sign
* Dollar sign
